## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

Using this [workflow](workflows/InsertAnything.json), the source image and ref_image are cropped and scaled to a standard size of 768*768 to generate the image.

The effect is shown in the figure below.

The Insert Anything LoRA still performs well at larger resolutions. Therefore, to avoid image quality loss caused by processing images to 768*768, you can also use this [workflow](`workflows/InsertAnything_noscaling.json`) to only crop the image for generation. In this case, you can set the image resolution more freely.

The effect is shown in the figure below.
